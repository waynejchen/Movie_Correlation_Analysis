Found that gross/votes(index = 0.63) and gross/budget(index = 0.74) are positively correlated. 
So we can roughly get three conclusions as below:

1.	For a movie, if its votes increase, its gross earning is also likely to increase.
   
2.	For a movie, a higher budget is likely to bring a higher gross earning.
   
3.	To realize a higher gross earning for a movie, the producers should better input a considerable budget and curate its quality to seek more votes.
